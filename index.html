        <div class="style-1">
            <img src="foto-praça-1.jpg" alt="Primeira foto da praça">
            <p>This is the square in front of the 12th building of campus 2. There are some trees and plants around the area, and a fountain is located between the stairs and ramps. There are also two large benches at both ends of the square. Students often play soccer or volleyball there during their free time.</p>

            <img src="foto-praça-2.jpg" alt="Segunda foto da praça">
            <p>We like this place because it's outdoors, and we enjoy spending our free time outside rather than staying in classrooms or buildings. We also like this spot because we sometimes play volleyball with our friends during our breaks.</p>

            <img src="foto-biblioteca-1.jpg" alt=""> <!-- Primeira imagem da biblioteca -->
            <p>This is the campus' library that is close to the 1st building of campus 2. When you enter the library, all you see is a reception desk, some individual study spaces, a ramp that goes to the other two floors and a stair that allows you to go to the second floor.</p>

        <div class="style-2">
            <img src="foto-biblioteca-2.jpg" alt=""> <!-- Segunda imagem da biblioteca -->
            <p>We love this place because it cotains what we like most: books and silence while studying. The cozy feel that the library gives is also a reason that we like this place. If you are the kind of person that wants to let time pass without being non-productive or unhealthy, I can assure that you'll love the library.</p>
